A banking chatbot is one of the easier and smarter ways to get banking related information
anytime, anywhere at fingertips. Despite every single bank having its own banking
application available on mobile, it is still a problem managing these applications as they
occupy more memory storage, and it will sometimes contain bugs. To overcome such
problems, we introduce a sample banking chatbot that replies based on user input
instantly. This conversation is end-to-end encrypted and only used in reinforcement
training of chatbot. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning concepts are
used to build this chatbot. The programming language used to build this chatbot is Python
(v.2023.22.1). HTML and JavaScript are used to implement this bot in browser. It uses
reinforcement learning to learn from its previous conversations, but the information of
user is kept safe without violating safety protocols.
